# Changelog

All notable changes to Vela-pinets, newest first.

## [v0.2.14]

### Added

- **Volume footprints for Pine's `request.footprint()`.** Both engines accept a
  `footprints` option — a host-supplied `FootprintSource`
  (`(symbol, timeframe, range) => Promise<FootprintBar[]>`) — and expose it to PineTS
  as the optional `getFootprintData` surface of the virtual market-data provider, for
  static runs and live streams alike. Vela owns bars, never order flow, so this is
  how a host with a footprint-capable data source feeds the `footprint` /
  `volume_row` API; without the option the surface is absent and
  `request.footprint()` answers `na` on every bar, as PineTS specifies. A
  `request.footprint()` inside `request.security()` asks the source for that
  context's own symbol and timeframe. The worker
  engine round-trips each call to the main thread (`fetchFootprints` /
  `fetchFootprintsResult`, the `fetchSeries` pattern), and `execute` merely flags
  that a source exists. Chart-type modifiers are stripped before the source is asked
  (order flow is never derived). Types `FootprintSource`, `FootprintBar`,
  `FootprintLevel`, `FootprintRange` are exported.

### Changed

- **Built against pinets 0.10.0.** The browser builds and the worker bundle inline
  pinets 0.10.0, the first release with `request.footprint()`. The `pinets` peer
  range stays `>=0.9.31`: on an older pinets the `footprints` option is inert and
  harmless.
- **Supports `@luxalgo/vela` 0.8.** The peer range widens from `^0.7.7` to
  `^0.7.7 || ^0.8.0`, so hosts on Vela 0.8 install this release without a peer
  conflict, and hosts on 0.7.7 or later keep working unchanged.

## [v0.2.13]

### Added

- **Each closed trade now reports its own ledger to the host.** The round trips a
  strategy exposes through its execution context (`trades`) carry Pine's per-trade
  figures under Vela's names: realized profit net of commission (`pnl`), the commission
  charged (`commission`), and the trade's worst and best excursion from entry
  (`maxDrawdown`, `maxRunup` — Pine's `strategy.closedtrades.max_drawdown` /
  `max_runup`, latched from each bar's high and low). A trade that has not set a figure
  — an open one has no realized profit yet — leaves the field absent rather than zero.

### Changed

- **Requires `@luxalgo/vela` 0.7.7 or later.** The per-trade ledger fields above are
  declared on Vela's trade type only from 0.7.7, so the peer range narrows from `^0.7.1`
  to `^0.7.7`. _(Breaking: hosts on Vela 0.7.1–0.7.6 must upgrade Vela to install this
  release; on those versions the fields would still ride along at runtime but without
  types.)_

## [v0.2.12]

### Added

- **`display` selects where a plot shows, surface by surface.** A plot declared
  `display.data_window` now has a row in the data window and nothing else; one declared
  `display.status_line` shows its value beside the indicator's legend title only;
  `display.price_scale` keeps the plot on the price scale without painting it; and
  `display.pane` paints the plot without reporting its value anywhere. Combinations
  with `+` are the union of their parts (`display.pane + display.data_window`), and
  `plotcandle()` / `plotbar()` honor the argument too. A plot whose color is `na` stays
  readable in the legend and the data window; only its paint is dropped. A plot that
  is neither painted nor on the price scale — a data-window-only or legend-only
  helper, a `display.none` fill anchor — no longer stretches the pane's scale. `-` works
  as Pine defines it with a PineTS that computes display set operations (the release
  after 0.9.33): `display.all - display.price_scale` keeps every surface but the price
  scale, `display.none - display.all` shows nowhere.

### Changed

- **Requires `@luxalgo/vela` 0.7.1 or later.** The per-surface plot display above
  exists only from Vela 0.7.1, so the peer range narrows from `^0.6.11 || ^0.7.0` to
  `^0.7.1`. _(Breaking: hosts on Vela 0.6.x or 0.7.0 must upgrade Vela to install this
  release; on those versions an off-pane plot would otherwise stay hidden everywhere.)_

## [v0.2.11]

### Changed

- **Works with `@luxalgo/vela` 0.7.x.** The peer range widens from `^0.6.11` to
  `^0.6.11 || ^0.7.0`, so a host on Vela 0.7.0 installs the engine without a peer
  conflict. No engine behavior changes.

## [v0.2.10]

### Fixed

- **A script run before any bars exist no longer reports a made-up result.** When a
  chart's initial data load resolves empty (a slow feed, an authentication race, an
  unresolved symbol), the script body never executes — but the run still reported a
  result claiming the generic "Indicator" title and a sub-pane placement, regardless
  of what the script declared. An overlay indicator added in that window (typically
  by a host restoring a saved layout) was torn off the price pane and stranded in an
  empty sub pane for good. Such a run now reports nothing at all: the loading
  placeholder stays on the declared pane with the declared title, and the first run
  over real bars delivers the correct result. Both engines behave the same.

## [v0.2.9]

### Fixed

- **Pane routing follows the script's declaration — in every declaration shape.** The
  declared `overlay` was read from two lossy sources at two different times: a raw-text
  match over the source at prepare (blind to the positional form, fooled by comments,
  string literals, and a plot's `force_overlay`), and the runtime context after the
  first run (the strategy runtime drops positional declaration args, and a variable
  argument arrives as a series rather than a boolean). Whenever the two disagreed the
  indicator moved mid-load: `indicator("I", "i", true)` mounted its loading placeholder
  in a sub pane and jumped to the price pane a moment later,
  `strategy("S", "s", true)` stayed in a sub pane for good, and an `overlay=false`
  script with a `force_overlay=true` plot flashed on the price pane before landing in
  its own. The declaration is now read from the AST scan at prepare and pinned onto
  every computed model, so the placeholder and the final pane agree from the first
  mount — named and positional forms alike, `indicator()` and `strategy()` both. A
  host's runtime `setProps({ overlay })` override still wins over the declaration.

## [v0.2.8]

### Fixed

- **The loading legend shows the script's declared title.** While a script computes,
  its legend row identifies it by the title read from the declaration — but scripts
  declaring it in the named form (`indicator(title = "…")`), or with an apostrophe or
  an escaped quote inside the name, showed the generic "Indicator" placeholder until
  their first run finished. Every declaration shape now resolves to the actual title
  from the moment the row appears.

## [v0.2.7]

### Added

- **Session-aware `closeTime` on the klines handed to PineTS.** The engine's kline
  contract takes an optional per-bar close time (its own net is `open + tf`) and asks
  providers for the _session_ close; the runtime now computes it template-locally from
  the chart syminfo (`session` / `session_extended` / `timezone`): the last intraday
  bucket runs short (15:00 + 1h → 15:15), a daily bar labeled at the session open
  closes at the session end, and a trading-day roll span (futures `1700-1600`) closes
  next-day. Whether the regular or the extended window rules is read off the bars
  themselves — any bar outside the regular span means the series is the extended tape.
  Wired through all three kline paths (primary series, `request.security` secondaries,
  the live provider). Continuous markets, W/M timeframes and out-of-window bars emit
  nothing and keep the engine's own net; holidays and early closes are deliberately not
  recomputed here — the resolved calendar stays the truth for consumers that need them.
  Fixes `time_close` (and the barstate historical/realtime verdict) reporting
  `open + tf` on session markets — futures and equities alike.

## [v0.2.6]

### Changed

- **Peer floor is `@luxalgo/vela` `^0.6.9`.** Declaration props, `force_overlay` on
  plots/tables, and Pine table cell sizing type-check against that release's engine
  port — CI `npm ci` was still installing 0.6.8 from the lockfile, which does not
  declare those fields.

## [v0.2.5]

### Fixed

- **Untitled markers no longer collapse into one plot.** PineTS keys a plot by
  title and its transpiler injects no callsite ids, so every untitled
  `plotshape()` / `plotchar()` / `plotarrow()` call landed on the same plot — a
  script with twelve untitled plotshapes painted only the last one, and a
  non-first call's `display` / `show_last` were silently governed by the first
  call. The engines now synthesize the callsite ids pinets' key resolution
  already understands (the call's stable position in the per-bar marker
  sequence), so each call keeps its own plot and its own plot-level options —
  `display.none` on any one call hides exactly that call. Two callsites reusing
  one title stay separate plots too.
- **`plotchar()` draws its character.** The `char` argument was ignored and the
  marker rendered as a circle; the character is now the marker itself (a
  text-only label painted in `color`, the `★` default when omitted), with the
  `text` argument rendered under it.
- **`plotarrow()` renders with Pine's semantics.** Up/down arrows default to the
  semantic bullish/bearish palette instead of the accent color (explicit
  `colorup` / `colordown` still win), arrow sizes scale with the bar's |value|
  inside the `minheight`…`maxheight` pixel window (largest |value| = maxheight,
  TV defaults 5…100) instead of one fixed size, and `0` / `na` bars draw no
  arrow instead of a stray default-shaped marker.

## [v0.2.4]

### Added

- **`force_overlay=true` now works across the plotting functions.** `plot()`,
  `plotcandle()` / `plotbar()`, `plotshape()` / `plotchar()` / `plotarrow()`, and
  `bgcolor()` carry the flag into the model, so a script in its own pane can pin
  those elements to the price pane — the drawing objects (`line.new`, `label.new`,
  `box.new`, `polyline.new`, `linefill.new`) already did, and `table.new` joins
  them. A `fill()` follows its two plots, as in Pine (where the function has no
  flag of its own and rejects plots with mixed flags): when both are forced to
  the price pane, the band renders there too.
- **Declaration props end to end.** Both engines now expose the mutable
  `indicator()` / `strategy()` declaration arguments (a strategy's
  `initial_capital`, `commission_value`, an indicator's `precision`, …) through
  Vela's new props channel: `prepare` publishes a props schema whose defaults are
  the _effective_ values (source-declared ← engine default ← Pine spec),
  `capabilities.props` announces it, and prop overrides — add-time
  (`addIndicator({ props })`), live (`handle.setProps`), or edited on the settings
  dialog's new **Properties** tab — are applied via the PineTS `.prop` channel and
  replay the script. Requires `@luxalgo/vela` with props support in the
  `ScriptingEngine` port.
- **`props` visibility engine option** (`PineEngine` and `PineWorkerEngine`):
  which scripts publish the declaration-props schema — `'all'` (default), `'strategy'`
  (only `strategy()` scripts get a Properties tab), `'none'`, or an explicit
  **whitelist of prop keys**, published in the list's order, so the host controls both
  the subset and the tab's layout (a script owning none of the listed keys gets no
  tab). Presentation-only: hidden props keep their source/spec values and programmatic
  `setProps` still applies.
- **`defaultProps` engine option** (`PineEngine` and `PineWorkerEngine`):
  host-level defaults for declaration props, applied beneath source-declared
  values — a script that declares the prop keeps its own value; one that omits it
  gets the host default instead of the Pine spec one. Folded into the schema's
  defaults, so the dialog opens on them and "Reset defaults" restores them.

### Fixed

- **Tables carry their full Pine styling to the chart.** Cell `width`/`height`
  percentages and an integer pixel `text_size` now reach the renderer instead of
  being dropped or rounded to the nearest named size. `text_formatting` works on
  cells: `table.cell_set_text_formatting` no longer crashes the script ("not a
  function"), and a `table.cell(text_formatting=…)` argument sets bold/italic
  instead of silently corrupting the cell's width. A script that calls
  `table.merge_cells` on every bar no longer accumulates hundreds of duplicate
  merge regions — and the merged region's origin cell is no longer mistaken for
  an absorbed one, which used to blank the merged title row entirely.
- **Plot arguments render with Pine's semantics.** `display` now controls pane
  visibility across the plotting functions: a plot declared
  `display.status_line`, `display.price_scale`, or `display.data_window` stays
  off the chart (previously the first two still painted), and `display.none` is
  honored by `hline()`, `fill()`, `plotshape()`/`plotchar()`, `bgcolor()`, and
  `barcolor()` too. `trackprice = true` extends the plot's latest value across
  the pane as a dotted level line — including the level-only idiom with
  `display.none`. `show_last = N` draws only the last N bars of a plot (lines,
  histograms, shapes, candles, backgrounds, and bar colors alike). `histbase`
  re-bases `style_histogram` / `style_columns` / `style_area` plots instead of
  always growing from zero. An `hline()` without a `linestyle` defaults to
  dashed (and an explicit `hline.style_solid` stays solid), and a plain
  `plot()` defaults to line width 1, both as Pine defines them.
- **`na` and `color(na)` act as invisible colors.** A `plot()` whose color
  evaluates to `na` on some bars painted those segments in the series' fallback
  color; they are now invisible while the plotted value survives (fills keep
  their anchors and the value stays readable). A `plotshape()` / `plotchar()`
  marker whose color evaluates to `na` draws nothing on that bar. And a label
  with `color = na` keeps its declared style's placement — the bubble is simply
  not painted (pairs with the matching Vela renderer fix for the placement
  itself).

## [v0.2.3]

### Fixed

- **`input.source()` works again — from the settings dialog and from defaults.** pinets
  0.9.31 (now the minimum peer) resolves a runtime source override — which crosses the
  host/worker boundary as the series NAME (`'hlc3'`) — to the named series' per-bar value
  instead of handing the raw string to the script. Through this addon every `input.source`
  script was broken **on add**: Vela echoes input defaults back as overrides on start, so
  even the untouched `"close"` default reached the script as a string and every derived
  computation was `NaN`. No code change in this package — this release exists to re-freeze
  the fixed pinets into the dist, because the inlined worker bundles its **own** pinets at
  build time: npm-updating pinets in a host application never reaches `PineWorkerEngine`
  (nor the browser-global builds). The peer floor rises `>=0.9.29` → `>=0.9.31` so a
  resolvable-but-broken pinets can no longer satisfy the range; `PineEngine` (in-process,
  pinets external) picks the fix up from the host's own install as usual.

## [v0.2.0]

### Added

- **Strategies show their trades on the chart.** PineTS's broker emulator was already
  running every `strategy()` script and computing the full ledger — this package simply
  dropped it. The adapter now reads `ctx.strategy` and emits ONE execution per ORDER
  FILL as `IndicatorModel.trades`, at the fill bar and price the emulator recorded (a
  market order filled at the next bar's open shows there). Ledger slices of the same
  fill merge back together: a reversal (an entry that flips the position) paints a
  single entry marker carrying the summed quantity, and an exit order that closes
  several lots FIFO paints once. Order ids label the markers; a `comment=` replaces the
  id. Vela paints them as trade markers on the price pane (arrows + labels + fill-price
  ticks — see Vela's changelog); both engines emit them identically (the channel rides
  the model through the worker unchanged).

### Fixed

- **A strategy script now reaches the chart with its declared identity.** Three defects
  hid it before: the prepare-time title regex only matched `indicator(` (every strategy
  flashed a placeholder "Indicator" legend title), the run metadata only read
  `ctx.indicator` — never set by a strategy — so the real title AND `overlay=true` were
  dropped (an overlay strategy landed in its own pane), and the whole `ctx.strategy`
  state was discarded. The declaration now falls back to `strategy()`'s config, and an
  overlay strategy routes to the price pane like any overlay indicator.

## [v0.1.0]

### Changed

- **This package is now Pine's only home.** Vela deleted its in-tree `PineEngine` /
  `PineWorkerEngine` (they no longer exist on `@luxalgo/vela`), so a Pine script can only
  run through this addon. Nothing changed in the engine code — the extraction was already
  behavior-identical — but two consequences follow: the workspace oracle suite
  (`oracle-tests/vela-pinets`) took ownership of the Pine scenario catalog and is now
  **Vela's** render oracle as well, and any Vela renderer/model change gets verified
  through here.

### Added

- **Run Pine from the playground.** A "Code" entry in the topbar opens a popup — a plain
  textarea, Run (⌘/Ctrl+Enter too), and an inline status — that executes arbitrary Pine
  through the addon engine with `chart.runIndicator`: injected only when the run succeeds,
  so a broken script reports its error inline instead of leaving a dead legend row. No
  package code changes; the page also picks up Vela's latest option vocabulary (the
  `provider` option is gone — a bare symbol resolves by provider declaration order, an
  `EXCHANGE:` prefix pins a venue) and now lists every unused option commented at its
  default.

## [v0.0.1]

The PineTS engines, extracted from Vela into their own addon package. Vela stays
Apache-2.0 and carries no Pine code; this package is AGPL-3.0 (as `pinets` is) and plugs
into Vela's public `ScriptingEngine` port — behavior parity with the engines Vela shipped
in-tree is pinned by the unit tests and by the workspace oracle suite, which replays
Vela's Pine scenario catalog through both engines.

### Added

- **`PineEngine`** — the in-process Pine Script engine: prepare (inputs schema +
  declaration metadata), static runs and re-runs, live streaming with an incremental
  context, `request.security` (HTF/LTF/cross-symbol, extended-ticker aware) through the
  chart's data feed, viewport-dependent scripts, context snapshots.
- **`PineWorkerEngine`** — identical Pine semantics off the main thread: the worker
  source is inlined at build time and spawned from a Blob URL — no separate file, no URL
  to configure. Same protocol-pinned behavior, heavy scripts never block the chart.
- **Browser globals** — `vela-pinets.global.js` / `.global.min.js` expose
  `window.VelaPinets` for script-tag usage next to `vela.global.js` (pinets bundled;
  `@luxalgo/vela` resolves to the page's `window.Vela`, never a second copy).
